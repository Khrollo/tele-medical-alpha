# April 1 Phase 2 Final Verdict

## Final Verdict

**NOT DEMO READY**

## Concise Rationale

The current production deployment fails too early and too visibly in the intended clinician workflow:

- both demo users land on `/` instead of the correct role home
- demo-critical client navigation is broken on live workflow screens
- waiting-room assignment does not transition into the visit workflow
- save / reopen / finalize persistence was not proven end-to-end

## What Was Proven

- Demo credentials work.
- Sessions are created and protected pages are reachable by direct URL after sign-in.
- Nurse can reach `/patients` by direct URL.
- Doctor can reach `/waiting-room` by direct URL.
- The shared validation patient `Cora Mercer` is visible in both nurse patients and doctor waiting room.
- `/open-notes` renders for doctor and shows at least one continuation CTA.

## What Remains Risky

- Post-login role landing.
- Client-side route continuity on patient chart / visit history / open notes.
- Waiting-room assignment.
- Save / history / reopen / finalize persistence chain.
- Social-history merge, because the save/reopen path never stabilized enough to test it.
- Twilio / recording / AI, because the workflow did not safely reach the call stage.

## What Is Acceptable Only Under Guardrails

- Nothing in the **current live deployment** is acceptable as a full end-to-end demo path.
- The repo now contains targeted fixes for:
  - post-login landing
  - deterministic date rendering on key client screens implicated in hydration errors
- Those fixes are **acceptable only after redeploy and a fresh production smoke**.

## What Absolutely Must Not Happen During The Demo

- Presenter logs in and lands on `/`.
- Presenter clicks `Visit History`, `Log New Visit`, `Assign To Me`, or `Continue Note` on the current production build expecting a stable transition.
- Presenter promises a live call / recording / AI flow that has not been re-tested after redeploy.

## Final Recommended Presenter Path

### On the current live deployment

There is **no recommended full presenter path** from sign-in to completion.

### On the next redeployed build

1. Re-run a 5-minute smoke using the exact demo accounts in isolated sessions.
2. Confirm role landing works immediately after sign-in.
3. Use one **pre-approved** patient/visit pair only.
4. Use a **continue-note** path only if it passes smoke that same day.
5. Prove save -> history -> reopen -> finalize before anyone presents it live.
6. Keep Twilio / recording / AI out of the demo unless that exact path also passes.

## Repo Changes Already Applied

- `app/(auth)/sign-in/sign-in-form.tsx`
- `app/_lib/utils/format-date.ts`
- `app/(app)/patients/patients-list.tsx`
- `app/(app)/patients/[id]/visit-history/visit-history-content.tsx`

These fixes lint/typecheck cleanly locally. They still need deployment and one more live validation pass before the verdict can improve.

## Batch 3 Addendum

On April 3, 2026, the current branch moved materially closer to demo readiness even though the **live deployment verdict does not change yet**:

- `RG-3` is now **fixed and behaviorally validated locally** on an approved nurse -> doctor handoff path.
- `RG-4` is now **fixed and behaviorally validated locally** on the same record: save, waiting-room handoff, doctor re-open, and sign all complete successfully.
- The two Batch 3 repo changes are:
  - `app/_components/visit/new-visit-form.tsx`: restore the post-save action modal after the save-triggered refresh so the workflow can continue cleanly
  - `app/_actions/visits.ts`: revalidate waiting-room / patient / visit caches when a visit is sent back to waiting room so the doctor immediately sees the assignable row

### What Still Needs Deployment Smoke

1. Nurse save -> send to waiting room on the hosted build
2. Doctor waiting room -> `Assign To Me`
3. Doctor save -> visit history/detail reopen -> sign
4. Fresh hosted history page confirms the signed state

Until that hosted smoke completes, the correct posture remains:

**Current production:** **NOT DEMO READY**  
**Current branch:** materially closer, with the full RG-3 / RG-4 path now proven locally
